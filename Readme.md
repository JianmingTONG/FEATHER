# Overview

FEATHER: A Reconfigurable Accelerator with Data Reordering Support for Low-Cost On-Chip Dataflow Switching

In this repository, we include all three key results of the papers, including
- Figure 12: end-to-end deployment on FPGA to run ResNet-50
- Figure 13: full design space automated exploration using LayoutLoop 
- Figure 14: the entire Verilog implementation of the whole on-chip computation part of FEATHER, that we use for ASIC synthesis and Place-and-Route

** The detailed execution of each step consumes significant amount of time to reproduce, and thus we attach all pre-run results in results_generation.py for reference. **

# Pre-run results and Figure Plot (Key results reproduction, Estimated 3 minutes)
```
pip3 install matplotlib numpy pandas
python results_generation.py
